# Source Connector for Oracle

This guide describes how to configure *digna* to connect to Oracle DB using either the native Python connector or the ODBC driver.

It refers to the screen **"Create a Database Connection"**.

## Native Python Driver

**Library:** `python-oracledb`  
**Supported Authentication:** Password-based authentication only

> ⚠️ For other authentication methods, please use the ODBC driver.

### *digna* Configuration (Native Driver)

Provide the following information in the **"Create a Database Connection"** screen:

```
Name:               Name of the connection. This is used for referencing the connection in other screens.
Technology:         Oracle
Host Address:       Server name or IP address
Host Port:          Port number, e.g. 1521
Database Name:      Instance name, service name
Schema Name:        Schema that contains the source data
User Name:          Database user name
User Password:      Password for the user
Profiling Mode:     The profiling mode determines how digna processes data and calculates metrics:
                    - Standard: Metrics are calculated directly on the source tables without copying the data.
                    - Permanent: Data for the inspected day is copied into a permanent table, and metrics are calculated on the copied data.
                    - Session: Data is copied into a session or temporary table, and metrics are calculated on this temporary data.
Work Schema Name:   When using "Permanent" profiling mode, work tables will be placed in this schema.
Use ODBC:           Disabled (default)
```

## ODBC Driver

The ODBC driver may support a broader range of authentication and connectivity options. This section focuses on password-based authentication using the driver **Oracle in OraDB21Home1**.

### 1. Install the ODBC Driver

Install the **Oracle in OraDB21Home1** (or similar) by following the vendor’s official installation guide.

### 2. Configure the ODBC Data Source

Follow these steps to configure a new ODBC data source using password-based authentication:

#### Step 1
![Step 1](images/oracle/create_odbc_data_source_step1.png)

Note:
The TNS Service Name must be configured in the tnsnames.ora file of your oracle client installation. This is where you provide the connection descriptor (host, port, service name).

#### Step 2 – Test the connection

Click the **Test Connection** button.

![Step 2](images/oracle/create_odbc_data_source_step2.png)

Provide the password and click **OK** button.

Now you can configure *digna* to use the ODBC connection, either with a **DSN (Data Source Name)** or a **DSN-less** setup.

### A. DSN-Based Configuration

#### *digna* Configuration

In the **"Create a Database Connection"** screen, provide the following:

```
Name:               Name of the connection. This is used for referencing the connection in other screens.
Technology:         Oracle
Database Name:      Database that contains the source schema
Profiling Mode:     The profiling mode determines how digna processes data and calculates metrics:
                    - Standard: Metrics are calculated directly on the source tables without copying the data.
                    - Permanent: Data for the inspected day is copied into a permanent table, and metrics are calculated on the copied data.
                    - Session: Data is copied into a session or temporary table, and metrics are calculated on this temporary data.
Work Schema Name:   When using "Permanent" profiling mode, work tables will be placed in this schema.
Use ODBC:           Enabled
```

#### ODBC Properties

```
name: "DSN",            value: "*digna*data_oracle"
name: "UID",            value: "your oracle user"
name: "PWD",            value: "{your password in curly braces}"
```

> 🔹 The `DSN` must match the name defined in your ODBC driver configuration.

---

### B. DSN-less Configuration

#### *digna* Configuration

In the **"Create a Database Connection"** screen, provide the following:

```
Name:               Name of the connection. This is used for referencing the connection in other screens.
Technology:         Oracle
Database Name:      Schema that contains the source data (same as Schema Name)
Profiling Mode:     The profiling mode determines how digna processes data and calculates metrics:
                    - Standard: Metrics are calculated directly on the source tables without copying the data.
                    - Permanent: Data for the inspected day is copied into a permanent table, and metrics are calculated on the copied data.
                    - Session: Data is copied into a session or temporary table, and metrics are calculated on this temporary data.
Work Schema Name:   When using "Permanent" profiling mode, work tables will be placed in this schema.
Use ODBC:           Enabled
```

#### ODBC Properties

```
name: "Driver",     value: "Oracle in OraDB21Home1"
name: "DBQ",        value: "(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=XEPDB1)))"
name: "UID",        value: "your oracle user'
name: "PWD",        value: "your oracle password"
```
